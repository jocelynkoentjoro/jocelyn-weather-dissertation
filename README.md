This project is about comparing the single and ensembled machine learning's performance in predicting weather data in areas across the city Leeds, United Kingdom. The chosen machine learning models used for this research are Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. 

There are 3 different locations that the writer set as the pinned location, they are Royal Armouries Museum, Trinity Shopping Centre, and Headingley Stadium, so there are 3 different files as each of the location has its own dataset.
